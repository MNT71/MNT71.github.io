        <p class="text">Hello, my name is <span class="bold">Maximus Brian Nye</span>, the son of <span class="bold">Lisa Dobbins-Nye</span> and the grandson of <span class="bold">Martha</span> and <span class="bold">Dick Dobbins</span>. 
            I have two amazing dogs named <span class="bold">Milo</span> and <span class="bold">Archie</span>, both golden (but not colored golden) doodles, and an indoor-outdoor cat, <span class="bold">Scout</span>. 
            I was born on <span class="bold">June 25, 2006</span>, in <span class="bold">North Adams, Massachusetts</span>, and then moved to <span class="bold">Concord, Michigan</span> at 2 weeks old. 
            I attended <span class="bold">Bean Elementary</span> and have been with the <span class="bold">Western School District</span> since then. 
            I consider myself a hobbyist with a large imagination that keeps growing.

        <p class="part">School has been a significant aspect of my life, as I derive immense <span class="bold">pleasure</span> and <span class="bold">fulfillment</span> from <span class="bold">learning</span>. 
            I've cultivated a deep passion for STEM subjects, particularly <span class="bold">math</span> and <span class="bold">science</span>, which led me to enroll in challenging courses such as <span class="bold">AP Calculus</span>, <span class="bold">AP Physics</span>, and <span class="bold">AP Computer Science</span>. 
            However, it's often assumed that students who excel in math may struggle with <span class="bold">English</span>. 
            Surprisingly, English was the subject where I faced a setback, resulting in the loss of my <span class="bold">4.0 GPA</span>, courtesy of <span class="bold">Mr. Kim</span>. 
            Nevertheless, I've made significant academic progress over the years, honing my <span class="bold">writing</span> skills under the guidance of <span class="bold">Mrs. Messer</span> in <span class="bold">AP Lang</span>.

        <p class="word"><span class="bold">Outside</span> of school, I am involved in various <span class="bold">athletics</span> and <span class="bold">clubs</span>, ranging from <span class="bold">Football</span> and <span class="bold">Track</span> to <span class="bold">Yearbook</span> and <span class="bold">Student Council</span>. 
            On the weekends, I work at <span class="bold">Walmart</span> as a <span class="bold">cashier</span>, which brings both interesting and headache-inducing experiences. 
            These adventures have etched enduring memories in my mind. 
            From the thrill of playing through the entire <span class="bold">district playoff</span> football game against <span class="bold">Lakeshore</span> to the pride of contributing 
            to the creation of the greatest <span class="bold">yearbook</span> ever produced in Western history, each moment has left an indelible mark on my journey.

        <p class="type">After completing my undergraduate studies, I have set my sights on obtaining a <span class="bold">master's</span> degree in <span class="bold">Aerospace Engineering</span> and <span class="bold">Business</span> from the <span class="bold">University of Michigan</span>. 
            I am passionate about exploring the intersection of engineering and business, and I believe that this program will provide me with the necessary <span class="bold">skills</span> and <span class="bold">knowledge</span> to excel in both fields. 
            During my time, I am determined to secure <span class="bold">internships</span> with renowned companies and organizations such as <span class="bold">NASA</span>, <span class="bold">SpaceX</span>, and <span class="bold">Lockheed Martin</span>. 
            Ultimately, I want to secure a permanent position in a company at the forefront of <span class="bold">innovation</span> in the <span class="bold">aerospace industry</span>.
