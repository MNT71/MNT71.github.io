        <p class="text">Hello, my name is <span class="bold">Maximus Brian Nye</span>, the son of <span class="bold">Lisa Dobbins-Nye</span> and the grandson of <span class="bold">Martha</span> and <span class="bold">Dick Dobbins</span>.
            I have two amazing dogs named <span class="bold">Milo</span> and <span class="bold">Archie</span>, both <span class="bold">golden</span> (but not colored <span class="bold">golden</span>) doodles, and an <span class="bold">indoor-outdoor</span> cat, <span class="bold">Scout</span>.
            I was born on <span class="bold">June 25, 2006</span>, in <span class="bold">North Adams, Massachusetts</span>, and then moved to <span class="bold">Concord, Michigan</span> at 2 weeks old.
            I attended <span class="bold">Bean Elementary</span> and have been with the <span class="bold">Western School District</span> since then.
            I consider myself a <span class="bold">hobbyist</span> with a large <span class="bold">imagination</span> that keeps growing.

        <p class="part"><span class="bold">School</span> has been a significant aspect of my life, as I derive immense pleasure and fulfillment from <span class="bold">learning</span>.
            I've cultivated a deep passion for <span class="bold">STEM</span> subjects, particularly <span class="bold">math</span> and <span class="bold">science</span>, which led me to enroll in challenging courses such as <span class="bold">AP Calculus</span>, <span class="bold">AP Physics</span>, and <span class="bold">AP Computer Science</span>.
            However, it's often assumed that students who excel in <span class="bold">math</span> may struggle with <span class="bold">English</span>.
            Surprisingly, <span class="bold">English</span> was the subject where I faced a <span class="bold">setback</span>, resulting in the loss of my <span class="bold">4.0 GPA</span>, courtesy of Mr. <span class="bold">Kim</span>.
            Nevertheless, I've made significant academic progress over the years, honing my <span class="bold">writing</span> skills under the guidance of Mrs. <span class="bold">Messer</span> in <span class="bold">AP Lang</span>.

        <p class="word">Outside of <span class="bold">school</span>, I am involved in various <span class="bold">athletics</span> and <span class="bold">clubs</span>, ranging from <span class="bold">Football</span> and <span class="bold">Track</span> to <span class="bold">Yearbook</span> and <span class="bold">Student Council</span>. 
            On the weekends, I work at <span class="bold">Walmart</span> as a <span class="bold">cashier</span>, which brings both interesting and <span class="bold">headache-inducing</span> experiences. 
            These adventures have etched <span class="bold">enduring</span> memories in my mind. 
            From the <span class="bold">exhilaration</span> of playing through the entire district football game against <span class="bold">Lakeshore</span> to the <span class="bold">pride</span> of contributing 
            to the creation of the greatest <span class="bold">yearbook</span> ever produced in <span class="bold">Western</span> history, each moment has left an <span class="bold">indelible</span> mark on my journey.

      <section class="align-items-center">
        <p class="type">After completing my <span class="bold">undergraduate</span> studies, I have set my sights on obtaining a <span class="bold">master's</span> degree in <span class="bold">Aerospace Engineering</span> and <span class="bold">Business</span> from the <span class="bold">University of Michigan</span>.
            I am passionate about exploring the intersection of <span class="bold">engineering</span> and <span class="bold">business</span>, and I believe that this <span class="bold">program</span> will provide me with the necessary <span class="bold">skills</span> and <span class="bold">knowledge</span> to excel in both fields. 
            During my time in the <span class="bold">program</span>, I am determined to secure <span class="bold">internships</span> with renowned <span class="bold">companies</span> and <span class="bold">organizations</span> such as <span class="bold">NASA</span>, <span class="bold">SpaceX</span>, and <span class="bold">Lockheed Martin</span>. 
            Ultimately, I want to secure a <span class="bold">permanent</span> position in a <span class="bold">company</span> at the <span class="bold">forefront</span> of <span class="bold">innovation</span> in the <span class="bold">aerospace industry</span>.

        <p class="mark">In my <span class="bold">senior portfolio</span>, I have created a dynamic <span class="bold">homepage</span> that includes a <span class="bold">picture slideshow</span> and an <span class="bold">inspirational quote</span> by the <span class="bold">greatest ever</span>. 
            As you navigate further, you will find my <span class="bold">introduction</span>, where I share glimpses of my <span class="bold">personality</span> and <span class="bold">aspirations</span>. 
            Next, I have designed my <span class="bold">career pathway</span>, which outlines my <span class="bold">academic goals</span> and <span class="bold">future profession</span>, using <span class="bold">coding skills</span>. 
            You can then explore my <span class="bold">portfolio</span>, which showcases <span class="bold">20 benchmarks</span> highlighting my <span class="bold">academic journey's growth</span> and <span class="bold">achievements</span>. 
            Additionally, there are <span class="bold">letters of recommendation</span> and <span class="bold">testimonials</span> from <span class="bold">mentors</span> attesting to my <span class="bold">capabilities</span>. 
            Finally, you can find my <span class="bold">resume</span>, which provides a brief overview of my <span class="bold">skills</span> and <span class="bold">experiences</span>, accompanied by visually captivating <span class="bold">word art</span>. 
            I have meticulously crafted every <span class="bold">element</span> of this <span class="bold">portfolio</span> to demonstrate my <span class="bold">proficiency</span> in <span class="bold">coding</span> and <span class="bold">design</span>.
