        <a class="grid-item">I received a <span class="bold">letter of recommendation</span> from Mrs. Sponsler, who serves as the <span class="bold">historian</span> of 
            Western High School, teaches <span class="bold">U.S. History</span> and <span class="bold">APUSH</span>, and advises the <span class="bold">yearbook staff</span>. 
            Over the years, I've had the privilege of working with her in four years of <span class="bold">Yearbook</span>, one year of <span class="bold">APUSH</span>, and a 
            semester of <span class="bold">independent study</span>, in addition to occasional encounters at <span class="bold">track meets</span>. 
            One of my earliest memories with Mrs. Sponsler was during a <span class="bold">Yearbook session</span> held amidst the <span class="bold">COVID pandemic</span>, where everyone wore <span class="bold">masks</span>. 
            Throughout high school, nobody has witnessed my <span class="bold">growth</span> as both a <span class="bold">student</span> and an <span class="bold">individual</span> more than her. 
            Her letter emphasizes my willingness to explore <span class="bold">alternative approaches</span>, embrace <span class="bold">learning opportunities</span>, maintain <span class="bold">focus</span>, and make <span class="bold">significant contributions</span>, regardless of the <span class="bold">role</span> assigned.</a>

        <a class="grid-item"><p>I received a <span class="bold">letter of recommendation</span> from Miss Pack, who initially served as a <span class="bold">math</span> and <span class="bold">health teacher</span> before transitioning to the role of <span class="bold">assistant principal</span> during our sophomore year. 
            While I've only had the opportunity to be in her <span class="bold">health class</span> throughout high school, her presence has been felt as she roamed the halls. 
            A memorable moment from my early days in health class was when I humorously referred to "<span class="bold">intercourse</span>" as the "<span class="bold">dance with no pants</span>" and was promptly sent out of the classroom. 
            Miss Pack has been a <span class="bold">significant figure</span> and support throughout my high school journey and as I pursue my <span class="bold">college endeavors</span>. 
            Her <span class="bold">endorsement</span> underscores the <span class="bold">impact</span> of her <span class="bold">mentorship</span> on my <span class="bold">academic</span> and <span class="bold">personal growth</span>. 
            Her letter highlights my <span class="bold">creative disposition</span>, <span class="bold">commitment to learning</span>, and <span class="bold">dedication to supporting</span> my peers both inside and outside the <span class="bold">classroom</span>.</a>
