            I received a <span class="bold">letter of recommendation</span> from <span class="bold">Mrs. Sponsler</span>, who serves as the historian of Western High School, teaches <span class="bold">U.S. History</span> and <span class="bold">APUSH</span>, and advises the <span class="bold">yearbook staff</span>. 
            Over the years, I've had the privilege of working with her in four years of <span class="bold">Yearbook</span>, one year of <span class="bold">APUSH</span>, and a 
            semester of independent study, in addition to occasional encounters at track meets. 
            One of my earliest memories with Mrs. Sponsler was during a Yearbook session held amidst the <span class="bold">COVID pandemic</span>, where everyone wore masks. 
            Throughout high school, nobody has witnessed my <span class="bold">growth</span> as both a <span class="bold">student</span> and an <span class="bold">individual</span> more than her. 
            Her letter emphasizes <span class="bold">my willingness to explore alternative approaches</span>, <span class="bold">embrace learning opportunities</span>, <span class="bold">maintain focus</span>, and <span class="bold">make significant contributions</span>,  <span class="bold">regardless of the role assigned</span>.

        <a class="grid-item">
            I received a <span class="bold">letter of recommendation</span> from <span class="bold">Miss Pack</span>, who initially served as a math and health teacher before transitioning to the role of <span class="bold">assistant principal</span> during our <span class="bold">sophomore year</span>.
            While I've only had the opportunity to be in her <span class="bold">health class</span> throughout high school, her presence has been felt as she <span class="bold">roamed the halls</span>, demonstrating her <span class="bold">dedication</span> to student's success beyond the confines of the classroom. 
            Miss Pack has been a <span class="bold">significant figure</span> and <span class="bold">support</span> throughout my high school journey and as I pursue my <span class="bold">college endeavors</span>, her guidance proving invaluable in <span class="bold">shaping my academic</span> and <span class="bold">personal growth</span>. 
            Her <span class="bold">endorsement</span> underscores the profound impact of her <span class="bold">mentorship</span> on my trajectory, affirming the depth of her investment in <span class="bold">my development</span>. 
            Her <span class="bold">letter</span> not only emphasizes my <span class="bold">creative disposition</span>, <span class="bold">commitment to learning</span>, and <span class="bold">dedication</span> to <span class="bold">supporting my peers</span> both <span class="bold">inside and outside the classroom</span> but also serves as a testament to her <span class="bold">insightful understanding</span> of my abilities and potential.
